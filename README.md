# Sort Hangouts Google Chrome Extension

**Problem:** The Hangouts tab is not sorted and the chats tab doesn't show my Hangouts!

**Solution:**

This Google Chrome Extension sorts the Google Hangouts tab in GMail by status. The new order after installation is:

* *Online* contacts at the top
* *Hangouts* in the middle
* *Offline* contacts at the bottom, sorted from A-Z

The sort order for Online contacts and Hangouts remain the same (last opened) while the offline contacts are sorted from A-Z so they can be found easier.
